This code was developed BG (Before Git).

I added unnecessary test.py files, and lacked 
understanding of proper Git Flow and Version Control.

#Fight!

Fight is simple PyGame project that I developed in 
2020 to test my understanding of Object Oriented Programming, after
a course I took in college.

It is quite simple to play:

A = Move Left

D = Move Right

Left Click = Attack

The goal of the game is to defeat the enemy, before he defeats you.
You can only attack once in range of the enemy.
